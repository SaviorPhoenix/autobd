## Getting autobd
Golang is required, so [get that](https://golang.org/doc/install). Most versions should work but it's probably best to
stick with at least 1.4.2 as that's what I'm developing on.

After you have go installed, it's as simple as either cloning the git repo:

`git clone https://github.com/tywkeene/autobd`

or using go get:

`go get github.com/tywkeene/autobd`

and to build

```
$ cd autobd
$ ./build.sh
```

## Getting it running

To run autobd , simply do: `./autobd -config etc/config.toml`

Autobd ships with two configuration files, config.toml.server and config.toml.node, to get you started running both


### Dockerfile

Autobd ships with two Dockerfiles and the scripts to deploy both server and node containers. You'll of course need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

#### scripts/deploy-server.sh
Usage: ./scripts/deploy-server.sh

Removes old autobd-server container, builds a new image, and deploys a new autobd-server container using the arguments:
```
DATA_DIR="/home/$USER/data/server-data"
SECRET_DIR="/home/$USER/secret"
ETC_DIR="/home/$USER/etc/autobd"
PORT=8080
```
These variables may be modified to suit your needs.


#### scripts/deploy-nodes.sh
Usage: ./scripts/deploy-nodes.sh n


Builds new autobd-node images, and deploys n nodes

#### scripts/kill-nodes.sh
Usage: ./scripts/kill-nodes.sh n

Runs ```docker rm -f```for n nodes

#### scripts/setup-network.sh
Usage ./scripts/setup-network.sh

Sets up a docker network for server and nodes to communicate. 
(I basically just use this testing, may or may not be useful to you)
