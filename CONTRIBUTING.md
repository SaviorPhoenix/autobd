### Bug Reports
When filing a bug report, please be clear and to the point. Try your best to come up with a step by step 'guide' to reproduce
what you experienced, and be sure to provide your git commit hash in your bug report. Before opening a new issue, be sure to
check existing issues. If you do find an open issue for the bug you are experiencing, simple +1 in the issue thread, so we know
it's more widespread, and feel free to help out hunting the cause down, sharing your findings in the thread.

### Pull Requests

“Talk is cheap. Show me the code.” 
― Linus Torvalds

That's all you really need to know. Besides that, share your rationale for why your pull request should be merged.
Remember, that's more code going in. That's more code that has to be combed over when looking for bugs, more code that has to
be maintained and tested. Try to follow the rest of autobd's coding style. Keep functions in files most relevent to what it's doing,
keep variable names descriptive, and be sure to comment.
